Oh my log! You found our humans.txt file!

If you are reading this, it means that you probably read too many logs in your life,
and now you are searching for the meaning of life in other textual files.

No worries though, we are all geeks, and we are all passionate about textual
representation of data.
Here at Coralogix, weâ€™re rebuilding the path to observability using a real-time
streaming analytics pipeline that provides monitoring, visualization, and alerting
capabilities without the burden of indexing.
