# Awesome Humans.txt

This project aims to curate a list of URLs from websites that include a **`humans.txt`** file. These files are significant as they acknowledge the human effort behind websites, giving credit to developers, designers, and all those involved in creating the web.

## What is humans.txt?

`Humans.txt` is an initiative to recognize the people behind a website. It's a simple TXT file placed within the root directory of the website that lists who has contributed to the building of the site. More information about this initiative can be found at [humanstxt.org](http://humanstxt.org/).

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to compile an extensive list of websites that implement **`humans.txt`**, to highlight best practices and promote its use among the web community. This list not only serves as recognition but also inspires more web creators to adopt this transparency.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Here's how you can help:

- **Submit a Pull Request**: If you know of a website that uses `humans.txt` and isn't listed here, please submit a pull request with the URL.
- **Spread the Word**: The more people know about this project, the more comprehensive our list can become. Share it on social media, blogs, and with your professional network.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**: If you have ideas on how to improve this project or want to suggest features for the repository, please open an issue to discuss it with us.

## Get Involved

This project thrives on community involvement. Whether you're a web developer, a student, or just someone interested in web transparency, your participation is highly valued.
Thank you for visiting and we look forward to your contributions!
